     start with x and y set to the largest 3 digit number and work downwards.
   Test in this order [999 999] [999 998] etc
   Then [998 998] [998 997] 
   But once the product is less than the largest, go on to next x.
   Also be sure to stop testing x and y when they are no longer 3 digits.

  "OLD VERSION-about 5 times slower than the version above. Largest palindrome product
Problem 4
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

 Find largest palindrome that is the product of two 3 digit numbers. 
 Returns a list of the 2 factors and the palindrome number
 Approach is to start with the largest product of two 3 digit numbers and
work downwards. If the number is a palindrome, try and factor the number into
2 3-digit numbers.
