  "Largest palindrome product
Problem 4
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

 Find largest palindrome that is the product of two 3 digit numbers. 
 Returns a list of the 2 factors and the palindrome number
 Approach is to start with the largest product of two 3 digit numbers and
work downwards. If the number is a palindrome, try and factor the number into
2 3-digit numbers.
